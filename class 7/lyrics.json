little girls like this I would kill him\n\nGuess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite\nWhen I'm ripping shit, but since when did this many\nPeople ever give a shit but I had to say\nIt's just my opinion\nIf it contradicts how I'm living\nPut a dick in your rear end and guess what\nEvery time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it\n\nFor drawing more attention toward it\n'Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude\nThought I was that important\nBut you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect\nAnd battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid\nAttaboy, they told me to slow down, and I just zone out\n\nGood luck trying to convince a blonde\nThat's like telling Gwen Stefan' she sold out\n'Cause I was tryna leave, no doubt\nIn anyone's mind one day I'd go down\nIn history think they know now\nBecause everybody knows\n\nEverybody knows that you're just an asshole\nEverywhere that you go, people wanna go\n\"Oh, everyone knows\"\nEverybody knows, so don't pretend to be

counting on you to count me out as Asher Roth\nWhen he round-a-bout dissed me to shout me out\nThought I was history\nBut goddamn, honkey, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey\nGood way to get your ass socked in the mouth\nLay'em off it\n\nBut what the f*ck is all this thrash talking about\nThe fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me\nYou knock me down, I went down from the count\nI fell but the fans caught me, and now\nYou're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me\nTo take my belt, word to Pacquiao\n\nMomma said there ain't nothing else to talk about\nGotta go in that ring and knock them out\nOr you better not come out\nIt's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quoting Shakespeare\nSo what if the insults are revolting\n\nEven Helen Keller knows life stinks\nYou think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled\nBut you should give little shit what I think\nThis whole world is a mess\nGotta have a goddamn vest on your chest, and a Glock\nJust to go out watch Batman\n\nWho needs a test to test the testicles, not that man\nHalf of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage\nRest of you got lap bands stuck to this model\nBefore they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado\nSo get lost, Waldo\n\nMy soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping\nA black hole that I'm swallowing this track whole\nWith a pack torn of paper\nBut I'm not taking no crap, ho\nHere I go down the back pole\nAnd I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go\nTrying to dip through the back door retreating 'cause everybody knows\n\nEverybody knows that you're just an asshole\nEverywhere that you go, people wanna go\n\"Oh, everyone knows\"\nEverybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice\nThere's no place you can hide\nYou

off in my lair\nAway from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit\nFrom this house it's quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it\nAnd I feel so isolated, nice I made it\nBut it's like

old\nBut especially when you don't know\nIf your conscience is sayin' I told you so\n'Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier\nOr you sold your soul\n\nIt's a fine, fine line\n\nAnd from here you look so small\nHovering high above us all\nPlease come back, to me\n\nI still remember the times when\nThey were simpler than the rhymes of\nVanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics\nI'll never forget what that feeling was like\nI miss those times now when I was just starting out\nWithout a dime and, now I'm diamond\nI can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been\nStuck in this house hibernatin'\nHate even going outside it\nSucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit browse\nI don't even want to buy nothin'\nI just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it\nLook how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and\nEverything about it I miss, which now reminds me\nPut a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz\nWow, I must have had Alzheimers\nLong time since I shouted them out, bout time\n'Cause it's been on my mind lately how\nZee, you always supported me\nYou vouched, I will never forget that and\nHow you

would use to continue the pattern of abuse\nWhy did I punch back?\nGirls your dad is a scumbag\nI'm confused because\n\nHow come you can be a low illusion\nHow come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?\nA good dad, but a bad husband\nWhy are you a good father?\nA great dad, but a bad husband\n\nYou wouldn't beat our love with a writer's block\nJust a line that's hot, that I forgot\nWe laughed a little, cried a lot\nI'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailey\nDay before you went to jail and daily\nHow we would wait for that mail lady\nOr by the phone, for mom to call\nAnd I watch you pull yourself up\nAnd we decided on giving it one more try despite it all\nYou're my lightning rod\nWhen my sky gets dark\nI'm your shiny rocks\nIn that tiny box\nWhen we tied the knot\nWhen we broke the knot\nEvery line we crossed\nWe were supposed to not\nEvery time we fought\nBeing souls they got\nThrown too far\nWords that we said that we didn't mean\nThe words that we meant that we didn't say\nThe ones that we thought that should've said\nLetters written that we could've read\nWhich maybe would've lead to some good instead\nAnd had this put to bed\nBut I'd be lying still if I said I wasn't sitting here asking myself\n\nHow come you can be a low illusion\nHow come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?\nA good dad, but a bad husband\nWhy are you a good father?\nA great dad, but a bad husband\n(Dad) (you said)\nForever be a hero in my eyes\nI reply\nThere's always another side to a good father\nA great dad, but a bad husband\n\nWe brought out the worst in each other\nSomeone had to make the sparring end\n'Cause I loved you but I hated that me\nAnd I don't wanna see that side again\nBut I'm sorry Kim\nMore than you could ever comprehend\nLeaving you was fucking harder than\nSawing off a fucking body limb\nOnce upon a time where all we had\nMaybe that's what drew us to each other\nIt was true love shit that we never knew was possible\nWe might have loved each other too much\nAnd maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other\nAll the screw-ups\n'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me\nAnd I was thinking I was more in love than you was\nFor all the times that we thought it worked\n'Till we saw how wrong we were\nWhen the dust settles now\nAnd all the dirt\nAnd if I touch the rawest nerve\nAll I want is for us to not hurt\nAnd it's been an exhaustive search to find the words\nBut I just heard mockingbird\nAnd got the urge to jot me some verses\nAnd thoughts the purpose was not to stir up open wounds\nI've caused a few, and so have you\nOr argue who's fault it was\nPartly yours, partly mine\nBut really no ones, this is so tough\nI'm getting choked up\nOh f*ck it, we both suck\nWe broke up, got back together\nWe both thought we had forever\nNot bad people, just bad together\nWe was so nuts, back stab each other, another blow struck\nBut there's no ducking this blow\n'Cause it's over\nAnd it's closure\nBut, I'm not so sure how to close this\nI just don't know how some people could be so good at one thing \nAnd so fucked at a whole 'nother shit it's no wonder\n\nHow come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?\nHow come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?\nA good dad, but a bad husband\nWhy are you a good father?\nA great dad, but a bad husband\n(Dad) (you said)\nForever be a hero in my eyes\nI reply\nThere's always another side to a good father\nA great dad, but a bad husband"}, {"artist": "eminem", "title": "offended.", "text":

everyone was tellin'\nYou don't sign me, everyone at the f***in' label, let's tell the truth\nYou risked your career for me, I know it as well as you\nNobody wanted to f*** with the white boy, Dre, I\u2019m cryin' in this booth\nYou saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours\nBut I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more\nBut I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me\nGet up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for f***\u2019s sake\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]\nIt literally feels like a lifetime ago\nBut I still remember the s*** like it was just

I've garnered?\nThe rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless\nAnd it always feels like I'm hitting the mark\n\u2019til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart\nLike, \"this shit is garbage\"\nGod\u2019s given me all this\nStill I feel no different regardless\nKids look to me like as a god, this is retarded\nIf only they knew, it's a facade and it\u2019s exhaustive\nAnd I try to

your expectations \nAnd meet 'em, but first, the \"Speedom\" verse\nNow, Big Sean, he's going too fast\nIs he gonna shout or curse out his mom?\nThere was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm\nEvery album, song I was spazzin' the f*ck out on\nAnd now I'm getting clowned and frowned on\nBut the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun\nAm I lucky to be around this long?\nBegs the question, though\nEspecially after the methadone\nAs yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground\nAnd all that's left of my house is lawn\nThe crowds are gone\nAnd it's time to wash out the blonde\nSales decline, the curtains drawn\nThey're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind\nAnd everyone who has doubt, remind\nNow take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times\nNow let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a f*ck about your rhymes\nAnd as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine\n'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight\nWhen I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?\nBut when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine\nI won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine\nBut I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water\nBut only when it freezes\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nI been making my

has passed ya\nYour weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you\nUsed to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed\nSo focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal\nAnd hit the corner fast, the more asserted\nNever looking back, may hit the curb\nBut everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life\nSometimes you might not

burning\nQuick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in\nBut you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it\nAnd as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down\nCause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'\n\nAs time passes, things change everyday\nBut wounds, wounds heal\nBut scars still remaining the same\nBut tomorrow today's

we gonna march\nThrough the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh\nTake us right through the doors (c'mon)\n\nAll the people up top on the side and the middle\nCome together lets all form and swamp just a little\nJust let it gradually build from the front to the back\nAll you can see is a sea of people some white and some black\nDon't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together\nTo celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather\nIf it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better\nThey ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever\nThey tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go\nRebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know\nStomp, push, shove, mush, F*ck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)\n\n[Chorus]\n\nImagine it pouring, it's raining down on us\nMosh pits outside the oval office\nSomeone's tryna tell us something,\nMaybe this is god just sayin' we're responsible\nFor this monster, this coward,\nThat we have empowered\nThis is bin Laden, look at his head noddin'\nHow could we allow something like this without pumping our fists\nNow this is our final hour\nLet me be the voice in your strength and your choice\nLet me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise\nTry to amplify the times it, and multiply by six\n\nTeen million people, Are equal at this high pitch\nMaybe we can reach Al-Queda through my speech\nLet the president answer a higher anarchy\nStrap him with an Ak-forty seven, let him go, fight his own war\nLet him impress daddy that way\nNo more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil\nNo more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal\nIf we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero\nLook in his eyes its all lies\nThe stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped\nAnd replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die\nIf I get sniped tonight you know why,\n'Cause I told you to fight.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd as we proceed,\nTo Mosh through this desert storm,\nIn these closing statements, if they should argue\nLet us beg to differ\nAs we set aside our differences\nAnd assemble our own army\nTo disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction\nThat we call our President, for the present\nAnd Mosh for the future of our next generation\nTo speak and be heard\nMr. President, Mr. Senator?\nDo you guy's hear us? hear us?

the sacred store\nWhere I'd heard the music years before\nBut the man there said the music wouldn't play\n\nAnd in the streets the children screamed\nThe lovers cried, and the poets dreamed\nBut not a word was spoken\nThe church bells all were broken\n\nAnd the three men I admire most\nThe Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost\nThey caught the last train for the coast\nThe day the music died\nAnd they
